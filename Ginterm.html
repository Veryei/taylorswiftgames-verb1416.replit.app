<h3> Fun fact #13 </h3>
  <p> For Taylor the number 13 is lucky for a number of reasons. In 2009 she told MTV: "I was born on the 13th. I turned 13 on Friday the 13th. My first album went gold in 13 weeks. My first Number 1 song had a 13-second intro. Every time I've won an award I've been seated in either the 13th seat, the 13th row, the 13th section or row M, which is the 13th letter." </p>
  <h3> Fun fact #14 </h3>
  <p> Taylor got the idea for "You Belong With Me" after hearing a friend of hers getting screamed at over the phone by his girlfriend.</p>
  <h3> Fun fact #15 </h3>
  <p> In its debut week, Red sold approximately two albums every second. </p>
