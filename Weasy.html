<h3> Fun fact #19 </h3>
  <p> Taylor wrote a 350-page novel when she was 12, which, so far, has never been published. Isn't that crazyy!? </p>
  <h3> Fun fact #20 </h3>
  <p> Taylor spent her early years growing up on her familyâ€™s Christmas tree farm, which her father had bought off one of his clients. </p>
  <h3> Fun fact #21 </h3>
  <p> She was originally going to name her seventh studio album Daylight before landing on Lover. But since the album was the follow-up to reputation, the singer thought the name Daylight would be a little too on the nose. So, when Swift wrote the song "Lover," she decided that would be the name of the album. </p>
