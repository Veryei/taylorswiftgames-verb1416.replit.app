    <p> Taylor Swift is a multitalented singer-songwriter who has managed to connect with millions of fans across the globe with her music. 
    When she was 13, Swiftâ€™s parents sold their farm to move to Hendersonville, Tennessee, so she could sign with country labels in nearby Nashville. She released her first album as a teenager, and was certified platinum a year later having sold more than one million copies in the United States. She then started to blend in pop in her second album fearless but not letting the country roots behind, and that was just the beggining of her career, as she's released many more incredible and record breaking albums from country, to pop, to indie folk, and the highest-grossing tour of all time: "The Eras Tour". And her story is not over yet! </p>
