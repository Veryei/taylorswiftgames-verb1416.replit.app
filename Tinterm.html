<h3> Fun fact #4 </h3>
  <p> When Taylor's sixth album, 'reputation' was released, she became the only artist to release four consecutive albums which sold more than one million copies in their first week of release.</p>

  <h3> Fun fact #5 </h3>
  <p> Taylor wrote "22" because she said it was (at the time) her favorite year of her life, because "you know enough [and] you still know nothing, but you know that you know nothing." </p>
<h3> Fun fact #6 </h3>
  <p> We all know how Taylor loves to include Easter Eggs in her music releases, and it seems like the release time of 'Midnights' was significant.
  Taylor brought out the album at midnight on 21st October 2022, which seemed like a fitting time given the name. But fans on Twitter figured out there was a deeper significance, as Taylor was exactly 12,000 days old at the time of release, which is symbolic of the number 12 and midnight! </p>
